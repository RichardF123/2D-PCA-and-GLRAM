# GLRAM, 2D-PCA and Eigenface(PCA)
Here I update the core coding of Three classical papers in the field of data compression, and show the effect on the ORL dataset    

the SVD file is the code of SVD on ORL to compare with these three algorithm  

the 2D-PCA file is the python code of 2D-PCA core code and its testing code on ORL  

the GLRAM file is the python code of GLRAM core code and its testing code on ORL  

the eigenface file is the python code of eigenface core code and its testing code on ORL  

In the three file, the code is to caculate the RMSRE score and show the restruct picture of three algorithm to compare their abilities

The ORL dataset can download form：
